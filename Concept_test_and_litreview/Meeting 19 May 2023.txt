Things we need to do in the future:

- Louise might look into additional variables from datasets in addition to ACS5.
- Tian might look into creating a GUI to allow users to view different visualizations based on race, air quality, etc.
- Tian is thinking about looking into how we are going to assign counties to each air quality station.
- We are probably going to average the air quality data across all stations per county to produce a final figure.
- SQL database because the air quality data is way too large.
- We are going to have to think about how we are going to clean up the air quality data frame.
- Air quality data: we want to get daily data on pollutants and condense that into a yearly measure by seeing how many days was there bad air quality by county.

- Louise will look into selecting variables from race, ethnicity, population, income (possibly different types; poverty levels might be interesting), employment levels, commute lifestyle, industry, education levels.
- Matthew will look into how to visualize based on counties only in the state.
