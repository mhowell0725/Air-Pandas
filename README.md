## Here is the repository for Air-Pandas!!

There is a growing body of literature detailing the relationship between the level of air pollution and the demography in different neighborhoods of Los Angeles (e.g. Jiang and Yang 2022). Despite their substantial implications on the quality of life of millions of people, the majority of the discussions surrounding this issue have remained in an academic setting. In this project, we plan to increase accessibility to this body of knowledge. To do so, we will interpret the existing literature for demographic trends in Los Angeles and how they relate to real air quality records, create a database of historical Los Angeles air quality and demographic data, and visualize the relationship between demographic and air quality trends. These tasks will require working with large demographic and environmental datasets, creating and working with a SQL database, and communicating the findings through complex visualizations.
