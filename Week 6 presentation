Hello everyone, we are air pandas. 
A little background of our project, in this project, weâ€™re gonna explore, analyze, and visualize the relationship between demographic trends and air quality in Cali. 
Our project is mainly based on the U.S. census bureau API and Air Quality System (AQS) API. 
In Phase 1 we gonna review some relevant research, then acquire, clean, query, and finally build a combined database based on these 2 APIs. 
In Phase 2 we plan on apply some statistical analysis to discover the underlying relationship between different demographic variables and different air pollution indicators. 
In phase 3, we want to communicate the findings in a vivid and accessible way. 
We are almost done with our phase 1, we have reviewed multiple literatures and found some interesting variables like income, PM2.5, etc in both APIs to start with. 
And my teammates gonna talks about some progress made on building the datasets.
